🎨 Black and White Image Colorization
Automatically convert black and white (grayscale) images to color using deep learning and image processing techniques.

🧠 Overview
This project applies a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model to add realistic colors to black and white images. It can be used to:

Restore old historical photos

Enhance monochrome images

Generate colorized art from sketches

📌 Features
✅ Fully automatic image colorization

✅ Deep learning-based approach (CNN / GAN)

✅ Realistic and natural color tones

✅ Supports multiple image formats (JPG, PNG, etc.)

🛠 Technologies Used
Python

OpenCV

TensorFlow / PyTorch

NumPy

Pre-trained deep learning models

Flask / Streamlit (optional for UI)
